The Clirr Maven Plugin

  {{{http://clirr.sourceforge.net}Clirr}} is an application, which allows
  you to compare binaries or sources for compatibility. The Clirr Maven
  Plugin allows you to use Clirr from Maven 2. This version of the plugin uses
  Clirr ${clirrVersion}.

* Goals Overview

  The plugin offers the following goals:

  * {{{./usage.html#Compatibility_Checks}clirr:check}} is used as part of the
    build to ensure a configurable level of compatibility.

  * {{{./usage.html#Generating_a_report}clirr:clirr}} generates a report for the
    project's website.
    
  * {{{./check-arbitrary-mojo.html}clirr:check-arbitrary}} Check for compatibility between two arbitrary artifact sets.

  * {{{./check-no-fork-mojo.html}clirr:check-no-fork}} Check for compatibility with previous version without forking the project
    
  []  

* Usage

  General instructions on how to use the Clirr Maven Plugin can be found on the {{{./usage.html}usage page}}.

  In case you still have questions regarding the plugin's usage, please feel
  free to contact the {{{./mail-lists.html}user mailing list}}. The posts to the mailing list are archived and could
  already contain the answer to your question as part of an older thread. Hence, it is also worth browsing/searching
  the {{{./mail-lists.html}mail archive}}.

  If you feel like the plugin is missing a feature or has a defect, you can fill a feature request or bug report in our
  {{{./issue-tracking.html}issue tracker}}. When creating a new issue, please provide a comprehensive description of your
  concern. Especially for fixing bugs it is crucial that the developers can reproduce your problem. For this reason,
  entire debug logs, POMs or most preferably little demo projects attached to the issue are very much appreciated.
  Of course, patches are most welcome too. Contributors can check out the project from our
  {{{./source-repository.html}source repository}} and will find supplementary information in the
  {{{http://maven.apache.org/guides/development/guide-helping.html}guide to helping with Maven}}. 

* Examples

  To provide you with better understanding of some usages of the Clirr Maven Plugin,
  you can take a look into the following examples:

  * Comparing the current version against a {{{./examples/specific-version.html}specific version}}.

  * Comparing the current version against an {{{./examples/specific-artifacts.html}arbitrary
    different artifact}}.

  * Ignoring differences that would {{{./examples/ignored-differences.html}otherwise be reported}}.
